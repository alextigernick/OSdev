# Primary memory

## File in memory entry - fmem

### Fields
| name     | type(size in bytes) |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| contents | unsigned short*(8)  |
| cur      | unsigned short(2)   |
| size     | unsigned short(2)   |
| bufSize  | unsigned short(2)   |
| flags    | char(1)             |
#### contents

**Type**: unsigned short*

Stores a pointer to the file data buffer. File data buffer is allocated to be file size plus the sector free space to allow for a file to expand to it's maximum size. The data in this buffer is initialized to the current data on disk, both in the file, and in the space after it. This allows for proper setting of the flash flag. Deallocated when the file closed after the write to disk has complete

#### cur

**Type**: unsigned short

Stores the current writing/reading location in the file. Needed for seeking operation.

#### size

**Type**: unsigned short

The current file size. This indicates where the last valid data byte is in a file. This is incremented as the program writes past the end of the file. Cannot exceed bufsize.

#### bufsize

**Type**: unsigned short

Used to store the size of the contents memory buffer. This is set on file open, and is used to determine if additional writes would overflow a sector

#### flags

**Type**: char

First bit says if the file is open. This is used in combination with the flock table to lock programs from opening files if they are already open somewhere else. 

The second bit is set if the data that has been written to the buffer would require the sector to be flashed. Allows for faster writes in the event that a write operation doesn't need to flash the sector. 

The third bit specifies if the file was opened for writing or not. Needed to allow for reads that don't flush to disk when closed.




## File in memory table - flock
### Fields
| name     | type(size in bytes) |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| files  | fmem(16)[NUM_SECTORS*NUM_FILES]             |
#### files
**Type**: array of fmem

Used to store the structure of every possible file on the disk. Uses minimal space because unless the file is open the memory buffer is unallocated. As the name implies this is used to prevent multiple openings of the same file. The index in the array specifies both the sector number and the file number within the sector.

<div style="page-break-after: always; break-after: page;"></div>


# Secondary memory
## File allocation entry - fdisk
### Fields
| name     | type(size in bytes) |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| name  | char(1)[8]             |
| size | unsigned short(2) |
#### name
**Type**: array of char

Used to store the name of the file. Not necessary, as files can be addressed by their sector/file number, but a convenience feature. If directories are later desired, they can be added by increasing the length of this field and storing the path directly in this string. Not null terminated as this field is fixed size.

#### size

**Type**: unsigned short

Specifies the size of the file on disk. Needed to allow for multiple files in one block.




## File allocation table - fat
### Fields
| name     | type(size in bytes) |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| fsector | fdisk(10)[NUM_FILES] |

#### fsector

One fat per sector, storing an explicit entry for each possible file. The number of entries in this table is set at compile time and dictates the number of files that can be stored in a sector.
